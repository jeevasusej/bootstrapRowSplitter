# BootstrapRowSplitter
For Angular ng-repeat, add 3 or 4 cols for every bootstrap row.

When we want to add bootrap columns in different hights, then the rows will collapse.
So in that case we need to add the needed columns for every row.
So that the columns will not columns will not collapse.

This works based on the bootstrap 3.3.7 based media queries.
